_To celebrate the art of hair wellness and Art Basel Miami Beach, Nutrafol has partnered with the Arlo Hotels and Absolut Elyx to launch a specialty cocktail featuring our Vitamin B-Booster._

Donning a smooth and subtle infusion of blueberry and B vitamins, the Absolut B-Boost Energy Elixir is a creative twist on a classic Manhattan.  The recipe calls for Absolut Elyx, antioxidant-rich blueberry water, Bianco vermouth, and Nutrafol Vitamin B-Booster, which is chock-full of restorative B vitamins. 

Why put B vitamins in a cocktail, you ask? First, it’s delicious, and second, B vitamins help power healthier hair growth through whole-body wellness. Think of the Absolut B-Boost Energy Elixir as a way to sneak in the vital B vitamins that help your cells stay energized throughout your Art Basel celebrations and holiday revelry. 

Bonus: The bountiful Bs give your immune system a boost and help your body clear toxins, which lowers your chances of waking up with a hangover.
