#### _To celebrate the art of hair wellness and Art Basel Miami Beach, Nutrafol has partnered with the Arlo Hotels and Absolut Elyx to launch a specialty cocktail featuring our Vitamin B-Booster._

Donning a smooth and subtle infusion of blueberry and B vitamins, the Absolut B-Boost Energy Elixir is a creative twist on a classic Manhattan.
The recipe calls for Absolut Elyx, antioxidant-rich blueberry water, Bianco vermouth, and Nutrafol Vitamin B-Booster, which is chock-full of restorative B vitamins.

Why put B vitamins in a cocktail, you ask? First, it’s delicious, and second, B vitamins help power healthier hair growth through whole-body wellness. Think of the Absolut B-Boost Energy Elixir as a way to sneak in the vital B vitamins that help your cells stay energized throughout your Art Basel celebrations and holiday revelry.

### Where to sip the Absolut B-Boost Energy Elixir during Art Basel Miami Beach.

The concept for this specialty cocktail was imagined and brought to life by Gary Wallach, the director of food and beverage at the Arlo Hotels. It’ll be served during Art Basel (December 2 to 8) at the Nautilus by Arlo Miami. You can also sip the cocktail while you’re getting a haircut at the Blind Barber @ Nautilus by Arlo during the week of Art Basel Miami Beach.

Not headed to Miami for Art Basel? No problem. You can also create the Absolut B-Boost Energy Elixir at home.
